**Workout 1 - Data Wrangling and Visualization**

**Concepts** 

Concepts covered in this assignment include working with `data.frames/tibbles` and producing plots using the packages `"dplyr"` and `"ggplot2"`. This assignment works with more complex file structures.

**Purpose**

The goal of this assignment is to find different ways to rank the NBA teams using only the player statistics from the 2018 season, and no other available data. These assumptions and ranking ideas are similar to the ranking systems of universities or the ranking of companies in a specific industry.
